Problem statement - In this problem we have given an input array which is even and we have to find pairs such that all the pairs are divisible by k 
contraints :
Constraints:

arr.length == n
1 <= n <= 10^5
n is even.
-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= 10^5

Thought Process : 
say (a+b)%k==0
then a%k + b%k ==0
so we created a array of remainders which stores the remainders of all the values now store it to map which helps in to find the remaining part of the remainder of one element
